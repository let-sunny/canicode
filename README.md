# Design Readiness Checker

A CLI tool that analyzes Figma design files and scores how development-friendly and AI-friendly they are.

## Problem

Designers hand off Figma files. Developers open them and immediately start guessing — is this auto-layout or absolute? Are these colors from a token system or hardcoded hex values? Will this layout break on different screen sizes?

These questions slow down implementation, produce inconsistent code, and make AI-assisted code generation unreliable. The gap between "looks right in Figma" and "actually implementable" is real, but invisible until someone tries to write the code.

Design Readiness Checker makes that gap measurable. It scans a Figma file's structure and produces a concrete score with specific, actionable issues — before any code is written.

## How It Works

### 39 Rules, 4 Severity Levels

Every node in the Figma tree is checked against 39 rules across 6 categories:

| Category | Rules | What it checks |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Layout | 11 | Auto-layout usage, responsive behavior, nesting depth |
| Design Token | 7 | Color/font/shadow tokenization, spacing consistency |
| Component | 6 | Component reuse, detached instances, variant coverage |
| Naming | 5 | Semantic names, default names, naming conventions |
| AI Readability | 5 | Structure clarity, z-index reliance, empty frames |
| Handoff Risk | 5 | Hardcoded values, truncation handling, placeholder images |

Each issue is classified by severity:

- **Blocking** — Cannot implement correctly without fixing. Direct impact on screen reproduction.
- **Risk** — Implementable now, but will break or increase cost later.
- **Missing Info** — Information is absent, forcing developers to guess.
- **Suggestion** — Not immediately problematic, but improves systemization.

### Density-Based Scoring

The score is not a simple issue count. It uses a density + diversity algorithm:

```
Final Score = (Density Score × 0.7) + (Diversity Score × 0.3)

Density Score  = 100 - (weighted issue count / node count) × 100
Diversity Score = (1 - unique violated rules / total rules in category) × 100
```

Severity weights issues — a single blocking issue counts 3× more than a suggestion. Scores are calculated per category and combined into an overall grade (A/B/C/D/F).

### Scoped Analysis

Pass a Figma URL with a `node-id` parameter to analyze a specific frame or component instead of the entire file. Useful for focusing on a single screen or section.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/let-sunny/design-readiness-checker.git
cd design-readiness-checker
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Requires Node.js >= 18 and pnpm.

## Usage

### Analyze a Figma file

```bash
# From a Figma URL (requires FIGMA_TOKEN env var or --token flag)
# Report auto-saved to reports/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-<filekey>.html
drc analyze https://www.figma.com/design/ABC123/MyDesign

# From a JSON fixture
drc analyze ./fixtures/design.json

# With a preset and custom output path
drc analyze https://www.figma.com/design/ABC123/MyDesign --preset strict --output my-report.html
```

### Presets

| Preset | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `relaxed` | Downgrades blocking to risk, reduces scores by 50% |
| `dev-friendly` | Focuses on layout and handoff rules only |
| `ai-ready` | Boosts structure and naming rule weights by 150% |
| `strict` | Enables all rules, increases all scores by 150% |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `FIGMA_TOKEN` | For Figma URLs | Figma personal access token |

### Output Paths

```
reports/                              # HTML analysis reports (gitignored)
  YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-<filekey>.html

logs/                                 # All logs and calibration data (gitignored)
  activity/
    agent-activity-YYYY-MM-DD.md      # Pipeline step logs
  calibration/
    calibration-analysis.json         # Step 1 output
    calibration-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm.md  # Calibration report
```

## Calibration

Rule scores are initially intuition-based. The calibration pipeline validates and adjusts them by comparing analysis results against actual code conversion difficulty.

### How it works

1. **Analysis Agent** — Runs the standard analysis and groups issues by node
2. **Conversion Agent** — Attempts to convert flagged nodes to code (via LLM + Figma MCP)
3. **Evaluation Agent** — Compares predicted difficulty (from rule scores) against actual conversion difficulty
4. **Tuning Agent** — Proposes score adjustments with confidence levels

If a rule flagged something as blocking but the conversion was easy, the rule is **overscored**. If conversion was hard but the rule gave a low score, it's **underscored**. Missing difficulties with no rule coverage become **new rule proposals**.

### Manual 3-step workflow

Step 2 (conversion) requires a Claude Code session with Figma MCP access, so the pipeline can be split:

```bash
# Step 1: Analyze
drc calibrate-analyze ./fixtures/design.json

# Step 2: Convert nodes in Claude Code session with Figma MCP
# (produces calibration-conversion.json)

# Step 3: Evaluate + generate report
drc calibrate-evaluate logs/calibration/calibration-analysis.json calibration-conversion.json
```

### Automated calibration loop

The `/calibrate-loop` Claude Code command runs a 3-agent debate for autonomous score tuning:

1. **Runner** — Executes calibration, extracts score adjustment proposals
2. **Critic** — Applies rejection heuristics (insufficient evidence, excessive change, severity jump)
3. **Arbitrator** — Resolves disagreements, commits conservative changes

```bash
# Run nightly calibration (reads URLs from .env)
./scripts/calibrate-night.sh
```

The script loops until scores stabilize (no changes) or max 5 cycles, with 30-minute waits between cycles.

## Roadmap

39 rules, density-based scoring, HTML reports, Figma API integration, presets, scoped analysis.

### Phase 2 — Calibration Pipeline (done)

4-agent calibration system, 3-step CLI workflow, markdown calibration reports, activity logging, `/calibrate-loop` autonomous tuning.

### Phase 3 — Analyze Report with Implementation Preview

Lighthouse-style HTML reports showing "if you implement this design, here's what you get" — Figma original screenshot next to Playwright-rendered code output, per node.

### Phase 4 — Ecosystem

Plugin system for custom rules. Figma plugin for in-editor feedback. Integration with design system documentation tools.
